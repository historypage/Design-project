        <p>The author of this website is the highly credible Aiden Torianyk. He is an avid history enjoyer with a grade
            average of 100% in his secondary 3 history class. Over the years he has gained much knowledge upon history
            and for this project he wanted to discover who was documenting history while it was happening. In other
            words;
            who wrote history throughout history. So for a coding project, he decided to take this as his subject and
            finally
